# Biomolecule_linear_correlation
This repository features code to integrate data from two different types of biomolecules using linear correlations. 

1. Collect proteomics and metabolomic data from the same samples. 
2. Using Quantify R or a different analysis pipeline, get the data into tidy format.
3. Navigate to (https://hickslab.github.io/Biomolecule_linear_correlation/) and follow instructions on the site.
